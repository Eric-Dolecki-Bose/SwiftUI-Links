### Tutorials / Documentation / Resources

* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/) | This is an intermediate to advanced book, focusing fairly narrowly on how to use the Combine framework provided by Apple. The writing and examples expect that you have a solid understanding of Swift including reference and value types, protocols, and comfort with using common elements from the Foundation framework.
* [Animation Library](https://github.com/amosgyamfi/swiftui-animation-library) | This link takes you to a collection of animation routines that could help jump-start other routines and approaches. There are some decent animations to be perused here.
