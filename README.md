# SwiftUI-Links
A simple gathering spot of my experiments and findings regarding SwiftUI.

I am a little wary of continuing much further at the moment because SwiftUI seems to be evolving over time and I have seen sample code change into different API uses - making it difficult to learn some of the Combine and other aspects without migration messages from the compiler in Xcode. This is all useful, and where applicable, I have updated old non-working code into servicable code that compiles and works. It's still slightly early days.

### Tutorials / Documentation / Resources
***
* [Using Combine](https://heckj.github.io/swiftui-notes/) | This is an intermediate to advanced book, focusing fairly narrowly on how to use the Combine framework provided by Apple. The writing and examples expect that you have a solid understanding of Swift including reference and value types, protocols, and comfort with using common elements from the Foundation framework.
* [Animation Library](https://github.com/amosgyamfi/swiftui-animation-library) | This link takes you to a collection of animation routines that could help jump-start other routines and approaches. There are some decent animations to be perused here.
